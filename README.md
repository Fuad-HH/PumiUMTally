# Tallies on Unstructured Meshes

---
*Keeps track of the distances traveled by particles in each mesh
elements to be used for tallies with tracklength estimators.*

## Features

* [Pumi-PIC](https://github.com/SCOREC/pumi-pic) and [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org/) Based (GPU and OpenMP parallelism)
* Distributed Mesh and Tallies with [Omega_h](https://github.com/SCOREC/omega_h)

## Working Principle
It works in the following way:

1. Copy origins and destinations and other necessary data of particles from the monte carlo transport code.
2. Move the particles to the destination.
3. Tally the particles.

## Compilation
Needs the following dependencies:

1. [Pumi-PIC](https://github.com/Fuad-HH/pumi-pic/tree/add_functor_to_search_mesh)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the `add_functor_to_search_mesh` branch will work on this. It can be compiled as directed by [PumiPIC Wiki](https://github.com/SCOREC/pumi-pic/wiki).

2. [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
> [!NOTE]
> Only when testing is enabled.
